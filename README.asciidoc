= IPC - InterProcess Communication

This repo contains artifacts for IPC, also known as networking.
The main contributions are the LCN guide (slide deck and appendix as a visual guide to IPC) and network examples.
The work here is based on PSOC and RINA, and a few European projects such as PRISTINE and ARCFIRE.
