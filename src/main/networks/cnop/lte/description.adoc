This is an example of cellular network offering Internet services.
The network models the UP protocol stack of an LTE or 4G mobile network.
Many of the original protocols (such as the tunnelling using GTP) disappear.
They are replaced by the _LTE UU DIF.
The _MNO_ Top Level} DIF provides the flows over the scope of the mobile network, including its _Metro_ and _Backbone_ parts.
The later two multiplex and transport the mobile traffic over the metro and core network segments.
The _Internet_ DIF is added to show a DIF for services and applications.
For simplicity, we only added 1 UE.
