This is an example of a network with Service DIF.
Service DIF are DIFs that provide IPC services end-to-end over the whole scope of the service provider network, as an ISP would normally do.
They allow customers to access "utility DIFs", such as a public Internet DIF, VPN DIFs independent of the used access technology.
They can also be used to hide mobility of clients within the scope of the service provider network (and from the "utility DIFs").

In this Service DIF network, a _Residential Service_ DIF is placed between the network and two utility DIFs called _VPN_ and _Internet_.
The access network is modelled as a wireless network (Wireless Network_ with an AP and a STA node).
Access could also provided via a fixed technology, such as DSL.

The aggregation of access traffic is realised by a _MAN Service_ DIF towards an edge service router.
The provider's core network then is a _Backbone_ DIF supported by a PE service routers (2 in this example).
_Residential Service_ carries the traffic of _VPN_ and _Internet_ up to the PE router.
