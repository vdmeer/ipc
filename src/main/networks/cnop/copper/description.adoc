This is an example of a fixed access network as a generalization of an XDSL network.
The schema focuses on the local loop, a fixed copper connection, between access routers and customer equipment called CPE.
Access routers aggregate traffic of several customers over the access segment, here some technology based on copper lines.
These access routers could also connect customers via other types of fixed access technologies, such as fibre.
A P router is used in the aggregation.
An Edge Service Router provides customer authentication capabilities independent of the type of access network.
