The \textit{core} is in charge of transporting traffic between core \acp{ict:net:POP}.
This traffic can come from
    the operator's customers (aggregated via access and \ac{ict:net:MAN} networks),
    local or regional \acp{ict:cloud:DC}, or
    other operators.
This network segment provides a transport facility to service \acp{org:psoc:rina:DIF} across the provider's main \acp{ict:net:POP}.
It deals with highly aggregated traffic carried governed by (very) different \ac{ict:net:QoS} promises.

This network provides a sophisticated design suitable for very large core networks, ready to scale-up if needed.
In this design, we find 2 levels of backbone \acp{org:psoc:rina:DIF}, L1 and L2.
\textit{Backbone Level 1} aggregates the traffic over several \ac{ict:net:MAN} core \acp{ict:net:POP} into regional core \acp{ict:net:POP}.
These regional core \acp{ict:net:POP} are all interconnected by \textit{Backbone Level 2}.
\textit{Backbone Level 1} is further divided into different areas, which map to the regions in the provider's network.
Its structure can be leveraged to design an effective addressing and forwarding scheme.
