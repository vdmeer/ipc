    \item IXP fabric must support performance and connectivity isolation
    \item Can use specific utility DIFs for each required isolation
    \item ``IXP Fabric''' transports traffic of multiple DIFs or DAFs (shown here)
    \item Supported by different Provider Edge (PE) routers
    \item Internally using Provider (P) routers for IXP
