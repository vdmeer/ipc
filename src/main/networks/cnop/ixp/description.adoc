This is an example of an interconnection or IXP network.
An IXP is essentially a third party providing interconnection services to service providers and network operators, who usually do host their own equipment (routers) in their facilities.
Using IPC, IXP are not limited to the exchange of traffic of a single type of inter-network.
Every service provider can exchange traffic belonging to more than one DIF, for example
    a general purpose DIF like _Internet_,
    VPN DIFs,
    DC interconnect, or
    application-optimized DIFs tat carry for instance interactive high-definition video traffic.

This network design addresses this situation.
An _IXP Fabric_ DIF transports traffic belonging to multiple DIFs (in this example structure _HD Voice_ and _Internet_) supported by different PE routers.
The configuration is very similar, if not the same, as the DC schema.
The difference is in what the fabric connects, PE routers or servers (and VMs).
_IXP Fabric_ needs to provide performance and connectivity isolation to the different `utility' DIFs.
