This example is an extension of the simple \acs{org:ieee:802:WIFI} layout.
We have inserted a \textit{Wireless Network} \acs{org:psoc:rina:DIF} to allow for more density of stations and \acp{ict:net:AP}.
The isolation of the upper layers (services) from the local mobility event (\acs{org:ieee:802:WIFI} segment) increases the scalability of the network, since the service layers only see the access router
This reduces the number of processes in the service layers and hides all mobility events, which are now handled exclusively by the wireless network.
In turn, the wireless network can now be designed for a point-to-point or multi-access.
It can contain all required wireless security, multiplexing, delimiting, and required layer management (e.g. for the channel selection on the physical medium).
