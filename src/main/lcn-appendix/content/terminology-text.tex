        Choice &
        A choice is a (graphic) mechanism, which can have one or more policies, choices is set of mechanisms from which one or more can be selected
        \\

        Option &
        An option is a (graphic) policy (of/for a mechanism), that changes the (graphic) behavior.
        A choice can have multiple policies, which might be used at the same time or exclusively.
        \\

        Fingerprint &
        A fingerprint is an abstracted (decreased details) image that can be used to visually (some textually) compare graphic elements;
        for instance fingerprints of systems.
        \\

        (Network) Schema &
        A schema is a schematic representation of a network, focusing on system classes and types,
        not showing all instances of systems in a network (e.g. only showing the class host but not many hosts).
        \\

        Network &
        Is a complete network with all systems (e.g. with all hosts)
        \\

        Tree &
        A tree in the mathematical sense, a connected graph without cycles
        \\

        \acs{ict:concept:DAG} &
        A \acl{ict:concept:DAG}, a finite directed graph with no indirect cycles (tree with directions)
        \\
